### How do I compile?
Compiling is simple, however for the time being you need to first compile the [WeaponLib](https://github.com/Paneedah/paneedah-weaponlib) mod and then continue these steps!
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the directory and create a folder called `libs`.
3. Place the compiled `WeaponLib-1.0.jar` jar file in the `libs` folder.
4. Run `./gradlew build` to compile the mod.
5. The compiled jar file will be in the `build/libs` folder (the one not ending with `-sources.jar`).
6. Enjoy the mod!
